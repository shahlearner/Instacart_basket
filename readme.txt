About the Project:
This is my first project as part of certification program at Edwisor.com.
The kaggle link of the project can be found here : https://www.kaggle.com/c/instacart-market-basket-analysis

Aim :
Instacart, a grocery ordering and delivery app, aims to make it easy to fill refrigerator and pantry with user’s personal favorites and staples when they need them. After selecting products through the Instacart app, personal shoppers review user’s orders and do the in-store shopping and delivery. The aim of the project assigned is to use this anonymized data on customer orders over time to predict which previously purchased products will be in a user’s next order.
